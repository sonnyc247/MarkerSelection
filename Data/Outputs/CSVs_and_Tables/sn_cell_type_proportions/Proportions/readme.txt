Most of these cell type proportion results were mapped using Seurat vignette default settings (for example, using 2000 most variable genes); 

Going forward, we will use top 20% most variable genes, but these result files for now will still be specified as such in the name (with "20Pct" of some form);

In other words, if a file is not associated with "20Pct", it was mapped most likely using 2000 most variable features
